A modular, extensible, magnet-based easel design for the AxiDraw V3/A3

_Designed by [Madeline Gannon](https://github.com/madelinegannon) and [Chris Ference](https://github.com/chrisference), May 2021_


## Overview
This easel helps you plot drawings that are larger than the 11" x 17" plot area of the [AxiDraw V3/A3](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/890). It features a grid system with magnetic clamps, fences, and addons that hold, align, and re-register your paper or machine as needed.

## Files
- Magnet Template
- Grid for drawing surface
- Machine Alignment Jig
- Corner Jig
- Straight Jig
- DXF Grid for making your own mods

## BOM
- 3d printing filament
- 24 inch x 24 inch x 3/4 inch plywood sheet(or larger)
- [7/16 inch diameter x 1/8 inch height magnets](https://www.mcmaster.com/5862K157/) 

## Tools / Supplies
- Hand Drill
- Drill bits up to 1/2 inch
- Hot glue gun / glue adhesive
- A3 (or larger) Paper
- Blue tape

## Add-ons / Design Guidelines

This project uses a 30mm grid as the base unit for each module. A 7/16 inch diameter x 1/8 inch height hole should be placed in the center of the square created by the grid to accomidate the magnets.

### Roll Holder

### Jetson Nano Holder

As of making this tutorial, a Jetson Nano holder has not been designed, however there are four magnets behind the circuit board of the Axidraw that can be used for mounting a Jetson Nano to. 

## Assembly Instructions

1. Start printing the various mounts and jigs provided above.

2. Using your AxiDraw, plot out the magnet template onto an A3 sheets and tape them together. 

3. Take the magnet template and mount it to the bottom side of your plywood. Note that because the magnets are mounted below the plywood, the template has been mirrored.

4. Using a 1/8" inch bit, start to predrill holes where there are + signs marked on the template. Work your way up to 1/2" inch holes being careful to not go through the plywood. Once this is done, check to make sure the magnets fit.

5. Using your hot glue gun, place a dollop of glue inside the holes drilled into the plywood. To place the magnet inside of the hole, I marked another magnet and placed it on the other side of the plywood and allowed it to magnetize to another sitting on the bottom surface. By dragging the magnet underthe location of the hole, it snaps it into place while ensuring the correct polarity of the magnets. 

6. Place a bit glue inside the holes of the 3d printed jigs and secure a magnet inside. Again, make sure the polarity of these are consistant with the ones placed into the board.

7. Once all of the magnets have been placed, it's time to mount the axidraw and jigs. The first one you will want to place is the Alignment Jig which will hold the AxiDraw's feet in place.

8. Once you are confident in the alignment of the machine, plot the gridded surface on top of the board. I've provide the Illustrator file if you want to customize the bed grid. Using the Corner Jigs, ensure the 0,0 position aligns with the inside corner. Sharpie worked best for us. Give it some time to dry, then continue.

9. That's it! Now, it's time to experiment with the machine. Here you can find a few tutorials we've created to help you get started :)
